% Energy model input CONSUMPTION.xlsx consists of:
% A time vector t of n x 1,
% An energy consumption matrix E_c matrix of n x m with m types of
% consumers (e.g. different locations or different behavior).

%sheetnameConsumption='Sheet1'; %probable name

% Meta data input META.xlsx consists of:
% producers p1, p2, p3 etc. of which the maximum capacity, location and
% production type is defined.
% consumers c1, c2, etc. of which the location is defined.
% transport efficiency t1, by which the loss of electricity transport is

%% LOAD DATA
% Load meta file:
% The meta file loads producers and consumers information. Producers p have
% the following format: p1, p2, p3 and are loaded in a structured array
% like Producers.capacity=[capacity p1; capacity p2 etc];
[metaNum,metaTxt,]= xlsread([fileLocation fileMeta],sheetnameMeta);
[Consumers, Producers, Transport, Constant]=loadMeta(metaNum,metaTxt);
[metaNum_example] =[metaNum];
[metaTxt_example] = [metaTxt];
clear metaNum metaTxt

%% Load consumer data:
% Consumer data will be provided by the Consumerfunction, which will output
% directly a E_c matrix with the consumption values per timestep.
E_c=consumerFunction(Consumers);
t=[0:(1/96):365]';

%% Load Wind Data:
%Load the Wind Distribution information obtained for each wind farm
%location. It is a matrix of as many rows as timesteps and with columns =
%nÂº of locations.
Wind_distribution = xlsread([fileLocation fileWind],sheetnameWind);

%% Central function:
%EPACE gives back the unmatched residual energies as function of time.
%Also the Transport matrix is filled in with where which energy is
%transported.

% Code is iterated until capacity of producers match the consumers.
% Storage efficiencies are not accounted yet: the iteration matches the 
% total year consumption with the total year production without storage
% losses. You will have to choose how to handle long and short term
% storage from these mismatch patterns, and correct for losses
% during storage.

Output=0; %Output variable suppresses making graphs.
[E_cres, E_pres, Transport, E_p_original]=EPACE(E_c,t,Consumers,Producers,Transport,Constant,Output);
for i=1:50 %Break either if mismatch is low or if counter is finished
    % Variables of the residuals are given. Consumption residuals E_cres
    % and production residuals E_pres. 
    [E_cres, E_pres, Transport, E_p]=EPACE(E_c,t,Consumers,Producers,Transport,Constant,Output);
    %Evaluation of mismatch:
    Mismatch=sum(sum(E_cres))-sum(sum(E_pres)) % Net shortage of energy per year
    MisPerc=Mismatch./((365*24)*(sum(Producers.capacity))); % Net shortage percentage of energy
    % The producing capacity is increased by a factor (100% + mismatch percentage). 
    Producers.capacity=Producers.capacity*(1+MisPerc/size(Producers.capacity,2)); 
    % *It is dividing the shortage percentage by the number of producers.
    if abs(Mismatch)<1 && abs(Mismatch)>-1 % 1 is arbitrary
        break
